    Colonoscopy PROCEDURE: ... A rectal exam was performed.
    The pediatric colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and carefully advanced to the cecum.
    The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve, the triradiate fold and appendiceal orifice.
    Careful inspection was made as the colonoscope was removed including retroflexion in the rectum. Findings- The preparation was good.
    There was melanosis coli in the proximal colon. There was moderate sigmoid diverticulosis. Internal hemorrhoids were seen.
    IMPRESSION: The patient is an 82-year-old female with history of colon polyps. Today's exam did not reveal any polyps.
    she did have melanosis coli, diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids. PLAN: No routine colonoscopy
